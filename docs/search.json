My name is Fangzhou (Eric) Liu!\nI am a full-time biostatistician in the Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences at Case Western Reserve University, as well as part of the Thoracic Oncology Program at University Hospitals. Meanwhile, I am also a part-time first-year Clinical Translational Science PhD student.\nMy work spans cancer epidemiology, health outcomes research, spatial analysis, and applied machine learning. I specialize in R, Python, Tableau, and ArcGIS Pro, and I am passionate about building rigorous, reproducible analyses that support scientific discovery and real-world decision-making.\nI am involved in several projects that integrate clinical data and social determinants of health. My current research includes cancer outcomes analysis using large administrative datasets, time-to-event and survival modeling, and spatial studies examining health disparities across communities.\nOutside of research, I enjoy photography, travel, and spending time with my wife, Yuan, and our cat, Kaba.\nWelcome to my website, and thank you for visiting!\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations."

    "text": "This gallery features eight of my favorite photos, all centered around our cat Kaba, who is truly the heart of our home. Four of the photos capture special moments between my wife and Kaba, showing their bond and everyday happiness.\nThe final two photos include a bit of Kaba’s mischievous personality:\n\nOne shows my wife with Kaba, sitting next to the book he bit.\nThe other is me with Kaba, with the same “victim” book (different places though) in the background.\n\nTogether, these images tell a small story about our little family — the love, the playfulness, and the funny moments Kaba brings into our lives."
